Leave them in your house for an afternoon, and you'll return home to find that they've taken over your city \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at which point, if you're lucky, you'll have just enough time to flee the planet before they claim it in the name of the Horde race.","wild":{"description":"During your regroup phase, if there is an unused player color, you may add a ship of that color to one of your colonies instead of retrieving a ship from the warp.
