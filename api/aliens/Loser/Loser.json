Considering original Loser's annoyance factor and its longtime dominant winning record, this change is probably a good one. Eon's Wild Loser was completely different: it forced the player receiving it to lose a colony and then eventually passed on, poison-like, to another player's hand.","edits":null,"tips":null,"classic_flare":null}
