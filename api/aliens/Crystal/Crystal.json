As a main player or ally, use this power after both main players reveal attack cards.

For instance, if your side reveals an attack 08, any one player on your side may discard an attack 08 to change the revealed card into an attack 64.","player":"Main Player or Ally Only","mandatory":true,"phases":["Reveal"],"lore":"Arranged in orderly three-dimensional lattices, Crystals tend to dominate the arrangement of their local environment.
