Whenever you lose a colony, you may use this power to search the discard pile, take one card of your choice, and add it to your hand.\nWhenever you would place one or more cards in the cosmic deck discard pile, you must instead place those cards faceup on this sheet. Cards on this sheet are not part of your hand. These cards are added to the discard pile whenever it is reshuffled to form a new deck.\nYou do not lose this power because of having too few home colonies.","player":"As Any Player","mandatory":false,"phases":["Start Turn","Regroup","Destiny","Launch","Alliance","Planning","Reveal","Resolution"],"lore":"Few races are as resourceful as the Scavengers, a species renowned for recycling, re-using, and at times re-eating virtually anything they come across.
