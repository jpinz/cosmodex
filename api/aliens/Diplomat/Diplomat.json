When you are not a main player and one or more attack cards are revealed in an encounter, you may use this power to play a negotiate card from your hand and turn the revealed attack cards into regular negotiate cards. Then, you and the two main players have two minutes to attempt to reach a three-way deal. Apply all unique effects found on the three negotiate cards. Unless all three players agree on a deal, the deal fails and each loses the appropriate number of ships. All three players are treated as opponents of each other for game effects that affect deals.","player":"Not Main Player","mandatory":false,"phases":["Reveal"],"lore":"A foreboding presence held in awe by other planetary life forms, the Diplomats strike only when their webs are fully spun. Then, for extricating those caught by their own rash acts, the Diplomats negotiate their terms.","wild":{"description":"When a deal is being attempted without you, you may play a negotiate card from your hand to remove one of the players from that deal and take his or her place. Restart the time limit. Your card's game effect applies, and you receive the deal's benefits or penalties as appropriate. If you make a deal, it counts as a success for the player you replaced.","player":"Not Main Player","phase":"Reveal"},"super_flare":{"description":"As a main player, after alliances are formed, instead of playing encounter cards to determine the winner you may call a vote of all players (defense wins ties).
