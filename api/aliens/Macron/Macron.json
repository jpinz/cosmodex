Power comes so naturally to them that they scoff at the fragile intelligences they crush on their way to universal dominance.","wild":{"description":"As a main player or ally, after your side reveals an attack card, you may add 1 to your side's total for each ship you have in the encounter.","player":"Main Player or Ally Only","phase":"Reveal"},"super_flare":{"description":"As the offense or an ally, you may send up to four ships into the encounter.","player":"Offense or Ally Only","phase":"Launch"},"retooled_gameplay":"Macron's ships under FFG are worth twice as much for compensation\/rewards as they were under Eon, and the new power text pinpoints specific windows during which the power can be zapped.
