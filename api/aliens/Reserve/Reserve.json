Showing the effective use of timing, the Reserves call in extra strength just when they need it most.","wild":{"description":"When another player discards a reinforcement card (whether after playing it or not), you may take it and add it to your hand.

Mayfair's Wild Reserve was completely different: it allowed the retrieval of all reinforcement cards played during the encounter. Mayfair's Super Reserve was significantly stronger, allowing any one attack card to be played as a reinforcement.","edits":"Edited to eliminate the name collision and to clarify that Super Reserve allows only one attack 07, 08, or 09 to be played.","tips":null,"classic_flare":null}
