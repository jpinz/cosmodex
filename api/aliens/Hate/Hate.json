At the start of your turn (after drawing a new hand, if necessary), use this power to force every other player to either discard a card or lose ships. First, choose and discard a card from your hand. Every other player must then choose to either discard a card of the same type (attack, negotiate, artifact, etc.) or lose three ships of your choice to the warp. If you discard an attack card, the other players must discard an attack card of equal or higher value. If another player has no cards of the discarded type, he or she must lose ships. If, after using this power, you do not have any encounter cards in your hand, draw a new hand.","player":"Offense Only","mandatory":true,"phases":["Start Turn"],"lore":"A short, physically unimposing race, the Hate evolved in a crowded part of the Cosmos and were pushed aside by other, more powerful, races.
