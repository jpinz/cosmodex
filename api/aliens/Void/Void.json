As a main player, when you win an encounter, use this power to remove the losing side's ships from the game rather than sending them to the warp. This occurs before any other game effects that affect ships headed to the warp. A player cannot be reduced to fewer ships than the number of foreign colonies needed to win the game. Any eradicated ships that would reduce a player below this number are sent to the warp as usual.","player":"Main Player Only","mandatory":true,"phases":["Resolution"],"lore":"Taught from vortexhood that no other intelligent life existed, the Voids were deeply offended to learn of alien races. They are now on a holy campaign to cleanse the heavens of all gross, material beings.","wild":{"description":"Once per encounter, you may send one of your ships not in the encounter to the warp to cancel the effect of any one artifact card. The artifact card is discarded as usual.","player":"As Any Player","phase":"Any Phase"},"super_flare":{"description":"You may use your power as an ally if your side wins.","player":"Ally Only","phase":"Resolution"},"retooled_gameplay":"Eon's Void could eradicate ships lost due to a failed deal, and allowed reducing a player to the point that he could not win (knocking that player out of the game), but could not eradicate Zombie ships. Eon's Wild Void did not require sending a ship to the warp to use the effect.","edits":"Edited to implement the FAQ ruling that Void trumps other powers like Zombie. (Some players dislike the Zombie ruling because it contradicts the historical interpretation of the powers as documented in previous editions' rulebooks and Encounter magazine (e.g. v1n4p16), and because it further degrades Zombie's viability as a competitive alien.)","tips":null,"classic_flare":null}
