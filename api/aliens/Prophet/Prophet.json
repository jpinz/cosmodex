When you are not a main player or ally, you may use this power before encounter cards are selected to predict aloud which main player (offense or defense) will win. A deal counts as a win for this purpose. If you are correct, you gain a colony on any one planet of your choice. If you are not correct, the winner selects any two of your ships and sends them to the warp.
