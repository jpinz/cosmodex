As a main player, after encounter cards are selected but before they are revealed, you may use this power and say either \"tens\" or \"ones.\" If you do so, any attack cards revealed in the encounter only use that digit as their value. For instance, if you said \"tens,\" an attack 40 would become an attack 04 and an attack 09 would become an attack 00, but if you said \"ones,\" those same cards would become an attack 00 and an attack 09.","player":"Main Player Only","mandatory":false,"phases":["Planning"],"lore":"A cunning, intelligent race from a binary star near a black hole, the Gravitons have mastered the ability to manipulate gravity. Herding and squeezing their enemies into tighter and tighter formations, the Gravitons rely heavily on their allies and reinforcements to finish the fight.","wild":{"description":"As a main player (if the Graviton is not your opponent), you may play this flare before encounter cards are selected.
