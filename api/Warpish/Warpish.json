Mayfair's and FFG's Warpishes eliminate the immunity to Wild Schizoid, which was necessary under Eon because of the unusual way Warpish set up his system. Eon's Wild Warpish was completely different: it let the player retrieve two ships at the start of his regroup phase. Eon's Super Warpish was completely different: it prevented other players from retrieving ships from the warp unless they had no colonies whatsoever.","edits":null,"tips":null,"classic_flare":null}
