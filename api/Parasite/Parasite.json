{"name":"Parasite","expansion":"Base Game","color":"Green","short_desc":"Joins Alliance at Will","game_setup":null,"description":"You have the power to Infest. When it is your turn to ally, you may use this power to ally (sending one to four ships, as usual) with one side as if you had been invited, even when you were not.","player":"Not Main Player","mandatory":false,"phases":["Alliance"],"lore":"Evolving late on their almost totally polluted world, the Parasites had to depend on the already dominant life forms for survival. But, so rapidly did they succeed in infesting their home planets, they now need unsuspecting hosts to carry them throughout the far reaches of space.","wild":{"description":"When another player loses the use of his or her power because of having too few home colonies, you may immediately establish a colony on one of his or her home planets with one of your ships. (If that player regains his or her power and loses it again on a later encounter, you may use this flare again in that system.)","player":"As Any Player","phase":"Any Phase"},"super_flare":{"description":"As an ally, you may send any number of ships you want into the encounter.","player":"Ally Only","phase":"Alliance"},"retooled_gameplay":"Eon's Parasite made itself accountable only to Force Field and Magnet specifically, whereas FFG's version is more wisely written to submit to all similar ally-controlling game effects. FFG's Wild Parasite wisely specifies that it only works on powers lost due to holding insufficient home colonies, whereas Eon's Wild Parasite could (unfortunately) be interpreted to also work just after things like a Cosmic Zap or Wild Reincarnator.","edits":"Edited to eliminate the incorrect reference to prevention by Force Field, to avoid implying that Wild Parasite can be played twice in the same encounter, and to fix Super Parasite's launch bug and incorrect timing bar.","tips":null,"classic_flare":null}
