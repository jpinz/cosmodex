As a main player, after encounter cards are selected but before they are revealed, you may use this power to call for a reversal. If one or both players reveal attack cards, this changes the value of those cards by reversing their digits. For example, this would make an attack 15 into a 51, a 20 into an 02, and an 08 into an 80. Resolve the encounter using these reversed values.","player":"Main Player Only","mandatory":false,"phases":["Planning"],"lore":"Springing from a world with such a high surface silver content that everything reflected off everything else, the Mirrors adapted to the difficulty of separating mirror images from reality. They also developed an inner symmetry that confounds their opponents across the Cosmos.","wild":{"description":"As a main player, after encounter cards are revealed, you may change your encounter card into a duplicate of your opponent's encounter card.","player":"Main Player Only","phase":"Reveal"},"super_flare":{"description":"When declaring a reversal, you may declare that it will affect only your card or your opponent's card.","player":"Main Player Only","phase":"Planning"},"retooled_gameplay":"Stone's Wild Mirror was completely different: it allowed a player to win by playing a compromise (negotiate) card, but required paying consolation. Mayfair's Super Mirror was different; it allowed the reversal to be called after attack cards were revealed.","edits":null,"tips":null,"classic_flare":null}
