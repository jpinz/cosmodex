When another player loses ships to the warp, you may use this power to heal all the ships he or she just lost and earn one card from the deck. Being healed does not prevent a player from receiving compensation or other benefits associated with the lost ships. A healed player may replace some or all of the healed ships on any of his or her colonies. During an encounter you may heal several players, drawing one card for each.","player":"As Any Player","mandatory":false,"phases":["Start Turn","Regroup","Destiny","Launch","Alliance","Planning","Reveal","Resolution"],"lore":"Rapid geologic activity forced extreme biological diversification on the Healer homeworld. Possessing vast knowledge of herbal and mutant lore, Healers are now prized by other beings for their life sustaining skills.

FFG's Wild Healer is stronger than Eon's, discarding the Cosmic Zap rather than just sending it back to the player's hand with no effect.","edits":"Edited for clarity.","tips":null,"classic_flare":null}
