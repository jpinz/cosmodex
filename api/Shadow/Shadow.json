Devoted to guerilla warfare and adept at choosing the most isolated and vulnerable targets as their victims, they mercilessly cleansed their sector of its overlords. Having become imperialists themselves, however, they now have new uses for their old talents.","wild":{"description":"As the defense, when you lose an encounter in which your opponent played an attack card, you may send one of your ships not in the encounter to the warp to take all opposing ships to the warp with you.
