The planet is removed from the game along with all of the opposing ships (your side's ships are sent to the warp as usual, along with any bystanders on the planet). A player cannot be reduced to fewer ships than the number of foreign colonies needed to win the game. Any ships removed from the game that would reduce a player below this number are sent to the warp instead.","player":"Defense Only","phase":"Resolution"},"super_flare":{"description":"You may force each player you weaken that has three or fewer ships in the encounter to lose all of those ships to the warp.","player":"Main Player Only","phase":"Resolution"},"retooled_gameplay":null,"edits":"Edited to clarify that Wild Guerrilla cannot blow up planets in other players' systems, to fix the attack bug, to define what happens to bystander ships on the planet, and to correct the \"as normal\" reference (it is not \"normal\" for winning ships to go to the warp).","tips":null,"classic_flare":null}
