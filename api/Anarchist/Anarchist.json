As a main player, whenever you lose an encounter or fail to make a deal, use this power to disrupt a game rule by revealing one disruption from your essence card cache. At first you keep the card faceup on this sheet and only you may use the disrupted rule.\nOnce per encounter, you may allow another player to move one of your faceup disruptions from this sheet next to his or her alien sheet. Now both of you may take advantage of that disrupted rule. Afterwards, you immediately reveal another disruption from your essence card cache.\nAfter any other player has used a disrupted rule, he or she immediately places that disruption in the center of the playing area and then everyone may use that disrupted rule. Disruptions are cumulative. When you have revealed all 8 disruptions, you win the game. You may still win the game via the normal method.","player":"Main Player Only","mandatory":true,"phases":["Resolution"],"lore":"The Anarchists take umbrage with the formalities of interaction used over the eons, smothering their opponents with unorthodoxy at every juncture.","wild":{"description":"You may rebel in one of the following ways: Instead of accepting your destiny card, draw destiny again.
