  "description": "You have the power of The Claw. Your claw is not part of your hand. Other players may not look at or draw it. At the start of any regroup phase, you may swap a card from your hand with your claw.\nOnce per encounter, when another player plays or reveals a copy of the card you have as your claw, if it is not a negotiate card, use this power and show your claw. After the end of the encounter, choose a planet in that player's home system, send all ships on it to the warp, and move it to your home system to become a new home planet for yourself (do not automatically establish a colony on it). Then, return your claw card to your hand and choose any card from your hand to become your new claw.\nEach stolen planet in your home system counts as a foreign colony toward your win, even if inhabited by other players. (If you gain a colony there, the colony is a home colony and the planet itself still counts as a foreign colony.)",
