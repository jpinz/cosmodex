Few knew it was all a scam, a generational confidence game of black-market purchases and using one race's abandoned input as another's miraculous output. Then, in an even darker age, as their intergalactic fraud seemed on the verge of exposure, the Alchemists discovered that harvesting and manipulating their own species' cerebella could provide the \"magic\" to make transmutation a reality. Thus was their operation finally legitimized, at a terrible cost.","wild":{"description":"You may discard one non-encounter card from your hand and take a different card of the same type (artifact, reinforcement, flare, etc.) from any discard pile.","player":"As Any Player","phase":"Any Phase"},"super_flare":{"description":"When transmuting an attack card, you may exchange it for another attack card of any value.","player":"As Any Player","phase":"Any Phase"},"retooled_gameplay":null,"edits":null,"tips":null,"classic_flare":null}
