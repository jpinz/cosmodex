As a main player, during the planning phase, you may use this power to mix the other main player's hand with your own. You and your opponent put your hands facedown on the table, and you mix them together. Then, choose how they will be returned:\n- Even Steven: Both players get an equal number of cards. If there is an odd number, you get the extra card.\n- As Is: Each player gets the same number of cards they originally had.\n- Switcheroo: Each player gets the number of cards the other player originally had.\nOnce you decide, the other main player takes his or her assigned number of cards at random from the mixed hands. You take the rest.","player":"Main Player Only","mandatory":false,"phases":["Planning"],"lore":"A seemingly wacky species, the Whirligigs are actually quite clever.
