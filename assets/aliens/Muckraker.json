As a main player or ally, at the start of the resolution phase, you may use this power to discard one card from your hand and accuse any or all winning allies of subversive intent. Each accused ally may bribe you to cancel your accusation against him or her by giving you, from his or her hand, any non-encounter card or a card of the same type (attack, negotiate, etc.) as the one you discarded. Attack card bribes must have a higher value than the attack card you discarded. Accused allies who cannot or do not bribe you must return their ships to their other colonies, and receive no rewards, colonies, or other benefits of winning the encounter.\nIf you are an ally and your side won, the main player on your side may exempt any or all allies from this power.
