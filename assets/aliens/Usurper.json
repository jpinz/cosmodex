As a main player, you may use this power immediately after encounter cards are selected (before any other game effects that apply after card selection). Every ally must play one encounter card facedown from his or her hand (first drawing a new hand if out of encounter cards). Look at the cards played by your allies. You may select one of them to replace your encounter card. You may select one of the opposing allies' cards (without looking at them) to replace your opponent's card. All replaced and unused cards return to their owners' hands and the encounter continues.\nIf a main player's encounter card selection is forced by a game effect such as Oracle, Magician, or Visionary, this power does not affect his or her allies.","player":"Main Player Only","mandatory":false,"phases":["Planning"],"lore":"Tactical advisors once employed by many great races, the Usurpers seized power in a bloodless coup. Through mind control techniques and technologies, they subtly wrest control of power from their enemies, causing others to achieve their goals for them. Even allies are gently forced to commit resources on their behalf, for the Usurpers trust no one but themselves.","wild":{"description":"As a main player, before allies are invited, you may choose to have the outcome of the encounter be decided based solely on the number of allies' ships per side. Whichever side has the most ships from allies will win the encounter (defense wins ties).
