Each time you lose ships to the warp, you may use this power to designate another player to substitute half the lost ships instead. Return half of your lost ships (rounded down) to your colonies. Then, your substitute makes up for the saved ships by choosing an equal number of his or her own ships to lose to the warp. That player may then take one card at random from your hand for each ship he or she lost. If you have too few cards, that player may draw the remainder needed from the deck.","player":"As Any Player","mandatory":false,"phases":["Start Turn","Regroup","Destiny","Launch","Alliance","Planning","Reveal","Resolution"],"lore":"Genetically sterile through a side effect of their colony's energy shield, the Sting desperately sought a way to save themselves from extinction.
