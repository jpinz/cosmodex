As a main player, after encounter cards are revealed, you may use this power to pray for divine intervention once per encounter. To do so, draw three cards from the deck. If none are encounter cards, discard them, and there is no further effect. If you draw any encounter cards, you may choose one of the drawn encounter cards to replace your revealed encounter card (which is then discarded). If you have revealed an attack card and choose another attack card for divine intervention, the new card may either replace or add its value to the value of your revealed attack card, your choice. All other cards drawn for divine intervention are then discarded, and the encounter is resolved with the new card or card value.","player":"Main Player Only","mandatory":false,"phases":["Reveal"],"lore":"A deeply spiritual and philosophical race, the Chosen have become attuned to a higher force in the Cosmos that they call upon in times of need.","wild":{"description":"As a main player, before encounter cards are selected, you may draw one card from the deck.","player":"Main Player Only","phase":"Planning"},"super_flare":{"description":"You may keep any non-encounter cards drawn from the deck while drawing for divine intervention.","player":"Main Player Only","phase":"Reveal"},"retooled_gameplay":"Mayfair's Chosen was considerably weaker, drawing one (and only one) encounter card to replace (not add to) the played encounter card.
