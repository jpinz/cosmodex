In a Virus-versus-Anti-Matter encounter, this retooling seems to eliminate the conflict about whether Virus' allies should be multiplied or subtracted (unless Virus has his Super flare, of course). FFG's Wild Virus is considerably weaker than Eon's, which allowed the player to square the total number of ships on his side. FFG's Super Virus restores the \"allies also multiply\" feature of Eon's base power in place of Eon's Super effect, which was to let Virus use his power for his side's benefit even as an ally.","edits":null,"tips":null,"classic_flare":null}
