As a main player, after alliances are formed, you may use this power to manipulate probability instead of having a normal encounter. If you do so, take a token and conceal it secretly in one of your hands. The other main player then chooses one of your closed fists. You then open both of your fists, revealing which hand held the token. If your opponent chose the hand containing the token, you lose the encounter. If he or she chose your empty hand, you win the encounter. In either case, the resolution phase is then carried out as usual.","player":"Main Player Only","mandatory":false,"phases":["Alliance"],"lore":"The Tricksters are a race of incredibly powerful beings, able to manipulate the very fabric of the Cosmos with their minds without ever leaving their homeworld. Fortunately, they have few dreams of conquest, instead preferring to select members of other alien races to toy with. Still, given their power, there's always the chance that they could take over the Cosmos by accident.","wild":{"description":"As a main player or ally, after encounter cards are revealed, you may flip a coin.
