As a main player, after the defense is determined, use this power. Either draw a card from the deck and add it to your hand or swap alien powers with your opponent. This power may be used only once per encounter.

Recently they have developed the unsettling ability to shed their psyches in exchange for those of others. Their standard greeting of \"I just don't seem to be myself today\" provokes panic in many a passing acquaintance as the Changelings leapfrog about the Cosmos.","wild":{"description":"At any time, you may draw a card at random from the hand of the player to your left. Afterwards, give this flare to that player.

This is a welcome change to many players who might have enjoyed Changeling as a concept but grew weary of the effect in actual practice. The revised version is less \"busy\" and more strategic. Eon's Wild Changeling was worded in such a way that you might randomly get your flare back; FFG's rewording nicely prevents this.","edits":"Edited to correctly refer to Warrior's tokens rather than the \"points\" he had in previous editions.","tips":null,"classic_flare":null}
