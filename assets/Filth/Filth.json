Any time any of your ships are coexisting on the same planet as any other player's ships, use this power to force the other player's ships to return to his or her other colonies.\nWhen you are the offense or an offensive ally, your allies in a winning encounter do not land on the targeted planet with you. However, they each still gain a colony on any other planet of their choice (each player chooses separately) in the defending system.\nAs the defense, when you lose an encounter on a planet where you have ships, use this power to force all opposing ships to return to their other colonies instead of landing on that planet. Your losing ships go to the warp normally and the planet is then \"fumigated.\"\nWhen you trade a colony to or from another player in a deal, each player granting a colony must vacate a planet for the other player to land on.","player":"As Any Player","mandatory":true,"phases":["Start Turn","Regroup","Destiny","Launch","Alliance","Planning","Reveal","Resolution"],"lore":"The Filth's reverence for the past leaves it unable to remove any trace of earlier events \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether yesterday's glatorp stains or last year's diseased kinzosh.

FFG has also cleaned things up a fair amount by eliminating the old redundant text about players re-challenging fumigated planets, and adding an excellent clarification that when allies land on other planets, they each get to choose one individually. Earlier versions gave the impression that all players are driven off a planet simultaneously, but FFG's version is written in the singular; thus the power drives away one opponent at a time (in the order of Filth's choosing) and is susceptible to a zap each time it does so.","edits":"Edited to clarify the reciprocal use of \"allies,\" to fix the old language (copied from both Eon and Mayfair) incorrectly implying that all colony trades involve colonies from both players (as written, Filth technically requires both to vacate planets even if only one colony is being granted) and to more safely attach this requirement to the actual trade itself rather than to the initial agreement (which could cause planets to be vacated too soon if something happens to alter or cancel the deal).","tips":null,"classic_flare":null}
